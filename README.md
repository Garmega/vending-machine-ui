# Introduction

Welcome to your GitHub coding test!

We know you've already spent plenty of your personal time during interviews.
Worry not; this is the last step of our process and it is designed to be
relatively quick. We appreciate both your time and patience!

We've hand-crafted a coding challenge in our problem domain, for your intellect
to chew on. We've designed the challenge to test your problem solving skills in
addition to your communication skills. Please, take the time to read through this
entire README.  

Good luck!

## Instructions

1. Read through this README for instructions and requirements;
2.Fork the repository;
3. Do the problem in your repo, using pull requests as a mechanism for grouping your code (feel free to merge your own PRs);
4. Send us a message when you're done!

## Problem

Create a [vending machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vending_machine)
browser application in React or the framework of your choice. 
The vending machine can take any currency you wish, and can sell any products
you wish. The vending machine should respond to basic actions, such as paying
and selecting products.

**Your primary objectives:**

1. Represent a basic data model that underlays the functionality.
2. Prototype (quickly) simple UI that allows the user to interact with the machine.
3. Create at least one action in the UI that behaves the way the user would expect. 
4. Choose whatever framework you wish. Some options you might consider: React, AngularJS, Ember.js, or Elm.

**Things you don't need:**

1. A working API.
2. Persistence. (You can  persist in-memory for now.)
3. Full implementation of the machine. (One or two actions is enough.)
4. Unit tests. (Really. We won't judge you.)

Please commit your work to branches in this repo and send us pull requests early
and often. You can mark them as 'work in progress' until they are 'ready for
review.' We will follow along as you add more commits, commenting and
collaborating with you. You have as much or as little time as you want. If you
are not sure how to best do this you can open an issue on the repository to
discuss the design and architecture.

## What we are looking for

* Thoughtfulness.
* Simplicity and speed.
* How do you communicate and incorporate feedback.

## Some guidelines to help you get started

As you will notice, this is not a simple algorithms or computer science test. 
We are trying to get an idea for how you think and how you communicate as a
teammate.  
  
Some things you might want to consider doing to help us along:

* Open pull-requests early.  
* Document your thinking (either in a PR or an Issue)
  * Why did you choose the frameworks and libraries you did?
  * What functionality did you choose to focus on?  To omit?  Why?
  * What were your design/archetecture considerations?
* Open issues with any questions you have.
  * What isn't clear to you?
  * Which assumptions are you making because of lacking information?
  * Don't feel obligated to wait for answers.  Feel free to make assumptions and proceed.
